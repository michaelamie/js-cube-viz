#js-cube-viz
#####A little cube visualization demo that pulls images and data from Instagram


#####To Do:

1. Finish cross-browser compatibility (originally, I did this as a hiring demo for a company that was only targeting Google Chrome)
2. The viewport resize code might be broken when resizing above 1280x800; I have no way to test this at home, currently
3. Implement multi-cube support
