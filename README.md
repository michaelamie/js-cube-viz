#js-cube-viz

*Cube visualization demo that pulls images and data from Instagram*

###Todo:
1. Finish cross-browser compatibility (originally, I did this as a hiring demo for a company that was only targeting Google Chrome for an appliance situation.)
2. The viewport resize code might be broken when resizing above 1280x800; I have no way to test this at home, currently.


###Demo
A demo displaying #kitteh can be found [here](http://mta-cube-viz.s3.amazonaws.com/cube.html)*

*As stated above, this is currently only implemented for current versions of WebKit / Gecko and has only been tested on Mac OS.

*Also: **not** responsible for the images this pulls from Instagram : )
